"2023 Israel Hamas war  An ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups has been taking place chiefly in and around the Gaza Strip since 7 October 2023, with clashes also taking place in the West Bank and Israel Lebanon border"
"On that day, Hamas-led Palestinian militants[o] launched a multi-pronged invasion of southern Israel from the Gaza Strip"
"The surprise attack comprised a barrage of rockets, while around 3,000 militants breached the Gaza Israel barrier and attacked Israeli military bases and civilian population centers"
"At least 846 Israeli civilians and 324 soldiers and police were killed during the attacks, while an estimated 240 Israeli and foreign nationals were taken as hostages to the Gaza Strip"
"Hamas stated that its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, rising Israeli settler violence and recent escalations"
"After clearing Hamas militants, the Israeli military responded by conducting an extensive aerial bombardment campaign in which 6,000 bombs were dropped on Gazan targets over six days and by imposing a total blockade of the Gaza Strip followed by a large-scale ground invasion of Gaza"
Israel's declaration of a state of war marked the start of the most significant military escalation in the region since the Yom Kippur War in 1973
"As of 3 December 2023, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than 15,500 Palestinians, including over 6,000 children as of 23 November 2023, have been killed, making this one of the deadliest wars for children in modern times"
Widespread civilian deaths have led to both Israel and Hamas being accused of war crimes
"Israel ordered Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza, while Hamas called on residents to stay in their homes"
The United Nations reported that around 1
"8 million Palestinians, and as of 19 November, around 500,000 Israelis have been internally displaced"
The war has led to a severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza
"The health system is in a state of partial collapse, most hospitals are out of service, and there are acute shortages of drinking water, food, fuel and medical supplies such as anesthetics for C-sections and amputations"
"The United Nations has warned of the ""immediate possibility"" of starvation and the spread of disease in the region, due to the cutoff of water, fuel, food and electricity by Israel"
"As of 11 October, at least 44 countries have condemned the Hamas invasion as a terrorist attack, while other countries have placed the responsibility on Israel and criticized it for occupying Palestinian lands"
The war has sparked widespread global protests that have focused on ceasefire
"The United States vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; a week later, the United States stood with Israel in rejecting a non-binding advisory resolution passed overwhelmingly in the United Nations General Assembly"
Israel has rejected calls for a ceasefire
"On 15 November, the UN Security Council approved a resolution calling for ""urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip"""
Israel agreed to a temporary truce following a deal in which Hamas agreed to release 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners
"On 28 November, Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce"
"On 1 December, combat resumed following the expiration of the truce"
"Background See also: Israeli Palestinian conflict and Gaza Israel conflict  The Gaza Strip and Israel have been in conflict since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, which it had occupied since 1967"
"The United Nations and several human rights organizations continue to classify Gaza as held under Israeli occupation, due to its effective military control over the territory"
"Hamas, an Islamist militant group, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election and a subsequent battle in the Gaza Strip between it and Fatah, led to it taking over governance in the strip, which escalated tensions with Israel"
"Israel, along with Egypt, imposed a blockade that significantly damaged Gaza's economy, citing security concerns as the justification"
"International rights groups have characterized the blockade as a form of collective punishment, while Israel defended it as necessary to prevent weapons and dual-use goods from entering the territory"
"Since the blockade, Israel and Palestinian militants have had several clashes and made attacks on each other"
The Palestinian Authority has not held national elections since 2006
Hamas tunneled under the border wall to launch cross-border attacks and fired rockets into Israeli territory
"This led to multiple conflicts, escalating into outright wars"
"Israel relied on the Iron Dome rocket defense system for defense, and responded with targeted strikes into Gaza, aiming to minimize the militant threat"
"Surveys in 2023 of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank before the war indicated that a majority supported the use of ""armed struggle"", the creation of ""militant groups"", and an intifada (""uprising"") against the Israeli occupation"
"Hamas's actions have resulted in it being designated as a terrorist organization by a number of western powers, including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others"
"China, Turkey, Russia and other countries do not regard Hamas as such"
"A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for ""acts of terror"" at the United Nations failed to achieve the required two thirds majority, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes"
"In February-March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to jointly conduct elections for a new Palestinian legislative assembly, in accordance with the Oslo Accords"
"Hamas committed to upholding international law, tranferring control of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a Palestinian state along the 1967 ceasefire lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital"
"According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at Bar-Ilan University, Mahmood Abbas subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States"
"In 2021, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Aqsa Brigades, started planning the operation which would break out on 7 October 2023"
"Hamas motivations Further information: Hamas Charter and Governance of the Gaza Strip  Hamas officials said their attack was a response to the Israeli occupation, blockade of the Gaza Strip, Israeli settler violence against Palestinians, restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, and imprisonment of thousands of Palestinians"
"Mohammad Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, said in a recorded message on the first day of the 2023 Israel Hamas war, that it was in response to what he called the ""desecration"" of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and Israel killing and wounding hundreds of Palestinians in 2023"
"He called on Palestinians and Arab Israelis to ""expel the occupiers and demolish the walls"""
"He continued, ""in light of the continuing crimes against our people, in light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western support, we've decided to put an end to all this, so that the enemy understands that he can no longer revel without being held to account"
"""  Other Hamas officials said that they expected a severe Israeli retaliation and were ""proud to sacrifice martyrs"
""" Hamas hoped that the attack would trigger a wider war against Israel"
The attack also was also seen as a resolution of internal tensions within Hamas as to whether the group's main goal is governing the Gaza Strip or fighting against Israel
"Following the attack, American counterterrorism analyst Bruce Hoffman pointed to the 1988 Hamas Charter, commenting that Hamas had always had ""genocidal"" intentions and that it had no intentions for ""moderation, restraint, negotiation, and the building of pathways to peace"""
"Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University and a former Israeli military intelligence officer, argued that the attacks were ""part of the long-term vision of Hamas to eradicate Israel"" and ""Hamas is not ready at all to give up on the jihad"
""" Israeli policy  Benjamin Netanyahu has been Israel's prime minister for most of the two decades preceding the war, and was criticized for having championed a policy of empowering Hamas in Gaza"
He has been accused of doing this to sabotage a two-state solution by confining the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority to the West Bank and weakening it in order to demonstrate to the Israeli public and to Western countries that Israel has no Palestinian partner for peace
"This criticism was leveled by several Israeli officials, including former prime minister Ehud Barak and former head of the Shin Bet internal security service Yuval Diskin"
"Along with the Palestinian Authority, Saudi Arabia was also critical of Netanyahu's government allowing Qatar to deliver suitcases of money to Hamas, in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire"
"Moreover, in recent years, Israel allowed up to 18,000 Palestinian laborers from Gaza to work in Israel as an incentive to maintain relative calm"
"A Times of Israel op-ed argued after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had ""blown up in our faces"""

"According to the Washington Post, the Palestinians were attempting to detonate an explosive device"
Al-Jazeera reported that a Palestinian Explosives Engineering Unit was working to deactivate the device

""" Israel denied receiving such a warning, but the Egyptian statement was corroborated by Michael McCaul, Chairman of the US House Foreign Relations Committee, who said warnings were made three days before the attack"
"According to the New York Times, Israeli officials had obtained detailed attack plans more than a year prior to the actual attack"
"The document described operational plans and targets, including the size and location of Israeli forces, and raised questions in Israel as to how Hamas was able to learn these details"
"The document provided a plan that included a large scale rocket assault prior to an invasion, drones to knock out the surveillance cameras and gun turrets that Israel has deployed along the border, and gunmen invading Israel, including with paragliders"
"The Times reported that ""Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision"
""" According to the Times, the document was circulating among Israeli military and intelligence leadership, who largely dismissed the plan as being beyond Hamas' capabilities, though it was unclear if the political leadership was informed"
"In July of 2023, a member of the Israeli signals intelligence unit alerted her superiors that Hamas was conducting preparations for the assault, saying that ""I utterly refute that the scenario is imaginary"""
An Israeli colonel ignored her concerns
"According to the Financial Times, alerts from the signals unit were ignored because they came from lower-ranking soldiers, contradicted the belief that Hamas was contained by Israel's blockade, bombing, and placation via aid, and the belief that Hamas was seeking to avoid a full war"
